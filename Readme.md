## 📋 Problem Description
This challenge involves predicting the presence of plant species at a given **location and time**, based on environmental and contextual data.

Each test point of attention (PA) sample `i` is associated with a set of **ground-truth labels** \\( Y_i \\), representing the actual species (by speciesId) present at that location.

The task is to submit a predicted set of species \\( \hat{Y}_i \\) for each sample \\( i \\), such that:
